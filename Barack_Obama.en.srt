00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 failures. J.K. Rawlings, who wrote Harry Potter. Her first Harry Potter book was

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 rejected 12 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 high school basketball team. He lost hundreds of games and misses thousands

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 of shots during his career, but he once said, I have failed over and over and over

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 again in my life, and that's why I succeed. These people succeeded because

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 they understood that you can't let your failures define you. You have to let your

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differently the next

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker. It

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 means you need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 mean you're stupid. It just means you need to spend more time studying. No

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 work.
