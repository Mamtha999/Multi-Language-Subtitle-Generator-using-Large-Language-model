00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 If you can't imagine life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before the

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 16th century.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Until then, chocolate only existed in Mesoamerica, in a form quite different from what we know.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned to prepare the beans of

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 the native cacao tree.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 The earliest records tell us the beans were ground and mixed with cornmeal and chili peppers

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 to create a drink.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter invigorating concoction, frothing with foam.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And if you thought we make a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 They believed that cacao was a heavenly food gifted to humans by a feathered serpent god,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 known to the Maya as Cuculcan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 as a reward for success in battle, and used it in rituals.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 The first transatlantic chocolate encounter occurred in 1519, when Hernán Cortés visited

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 the court of Montezuma at Tenochtitlan.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 As recorded by Cortés Lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink brought out and poured

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 into golden cups.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 When the colonists returned with shipments of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 accounts of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 At first, its bitter taste made it suitable as a medicine for ailments like upset stomachs.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 But sweetening it with honey, sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 in the Spanish court.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And soon no aristocratic home was complete without dedicated chocolate ware.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 The fashionable drink was difficult and time-consuming to produce on a large scale.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 That involved using plantations and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and on islands

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 off the coast of Africa.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 The world of chocolate would change forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 press by Conrad van Houten of Amsterdam.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Van Houten's invention could separate the cocoa's natural fat or cocoa butter.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 This left a powder that could be mixed into a drinkable solution or recombined with the

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate we know today.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix,

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 thus inventing milk chocolate.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 By the 20th century, chocolate was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 the public.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Meeting the massive demand required more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Now, instead of African slaves being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 production itself would shift to West Africa, with Côte d'Ivoire providing two-fifths

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 of the world's cocoa as of 2015.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Yet along with the growth of the industry, there have been horrific abuses of human rights.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Many of the plantations throughout West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and child labor, with an estimation of more than two million children affected.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 This is a complex problem that persists despite efforts from major chocolate companies to

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 partner with African nations to reduce child and indentured labor practices.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Today, chocolate has established itself in the rituals of our modern culture.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Due to its colonial association with native cultures, combined with the power of advertising,

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 chocolate retains an aura of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Yet knowing more about its fascinating and often cruel history, as well as its production

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 today, tells us where these associations originate and what they hide.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So as you unwrap your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that not everything

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 about chocolate is sweet.
